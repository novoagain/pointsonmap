# pointsonmap
The project presents a simple html page with a Russia map that hase a choose file button. After picking up the file [the d3 library](https://github.com/d3/d3) lays out on the map the expected points with delivered coordinates. The feature: input text file should be encoded in windows-1251. For conversion into UTF-8 used the [code](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/windows-1251) of Mathias Bynens.

## File with coordinates
Required format for the file - text with tab separated values or .tsv. It's a common format for data interchange and could be generated by Excel.  
Minimum requirements for headers in the file: 'lon', 'lat'. Other fields are not restricted but will not be prosecced. In the same time they could enter the game with minor changes of script inside index.html. There's even commented i.e. spleeping strings of code for drawing of points' titles.  
Text in the file should be in win-1251 encoding - the default export format for Excel in Russian region.
