# pointsonmap
The project presents a simple html page with a Russia map that hase a choose file button. After picking up the file [the d3 library](https://github.com/d3/d3) lays out on the map the expected points with delivered coordinates. The feature: input text file should be encoded in windows-1251. For conversion into UTF-8 used the [code](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/windows-1251) of Mathias Bynens.

## File with coordinates
Required format for the file - text with tab separated values or .tsv. It's a common format for data interchange and could be generated by Excel.  
Minimum requirements for headers in the file: 'lon', 'lat'. Other fields are not restricted but will not be prosecced. In the same time they could enter the game with minor changes of script inside `index.html`. There's even commented i.e. spleeping strings of code for drawing of points' titles.  
The required decimal separator for coordinates - the point `.`.  
Text in the file should be in win-1251 encoding - the default export format for Excel in Russian region.

## The map
The [map](https://gist.github.com/novoagain/1ba16ed97ba8dc23b59b2c4360194f28) of the Russian Federation shows all of its 85 regions. It's in topojson format and displayed by d3.js in Equal Conic projection named Albers Russia. While the datum is stored in the WGS84 format.  


## To test the code
The gist with `index.html` page of this project could be [tested](https://bl.ocks.org/novoagain/raw/2fddc384a1f06fdbbe7affc85a9d9b4d/) with the help of [bl.ocks.org](bl.ocks.org).
